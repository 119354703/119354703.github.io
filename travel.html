			<h3> Euro Disney Trip</h3>

			<h3> France</h3>

		</div>	
	
		<div class="rome">
			<h3> Rome Trip</h3>
				<p>I went to Rome with my family and my extended family in 2015 for a four day sight-seeing trip. We saw all of the major monuments such as St.Peters Basilica, The Colosseum, The Roman Forum and the Pantheon. We ate lots of pizza, pasta and ice cream and drank lots of water as it was 35 degrees Celsius for the 4 days. </p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="London">
			<h3> London Trip</h3>
				<p>  I travelled to London in January 2019 with my English class. We went to the Globe Theatre to see a play called Macbeth which we were studying for the Leaving Certificate. We also went to Covent Gardens, where we were allowed to go shopping. It was an all around good experience and I would love to go back again.</p>
