			<h1>Indoor Trampoline Park</h1>
				<p> I started working in the Indoor Trampoline Park in June of 2019 after I completed my Leaving Certificate. I worked in this Indoor Arena for 4 months before it was changed, refurbished and became an Indoor Inflatable Park. My job is to supervise kids/parents as they use the Inflatable Arena and to make sure that they do not get hurt or hurt anyone else. The Inflatable Arena at over 15,000 Square Feet is the largest and newest in Ireland and has plenty to do for children of all ages (even those over 18 years).</p>

				<p> I worked in the Cork Summer Show during the Summer of 2018. My job was in security. My job was to make sure that equipment was not stolen when the people were not using it.</p>
